# hello-world
This is a repository for CodeDay Labs assignment

I am James Pesta, an aspiring Web Developer. I'm also an astrologer, a practitioner of CranioSacral Therapy, a sound bath creator, and overall visionary, artist, and manifestor. I believe a modern and balanced world requires integration of both natural and artifical technologies and processes. My dream is to bridge people together with these technologies, greater strength in communication, and embodying the wisdom of being human.

You can check out some of my work at www.doublevisionweb.tech/wordpress and my astrology information at www.seethesoulastrology.com. As I continue to grow both in technology skills and life skills, my creations will be updated.
